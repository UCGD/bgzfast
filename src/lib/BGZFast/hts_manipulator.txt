NAME
    BGZFast::hts_manipulator - Manipulation of sequence realated file
    structure

SYNOPSIS
      use BGZFast::hts_manipulator;

      # Jump to start of first feature after given file position
      my $obj = BGZFast::hts_manipulator->new('/path/to/file.gff.gz');
      my ($real, $virtual) = $obj->smart_seek(10_000_000); #pos is real file

      # Get position from index file
      ($real, $virtual) = $obj->query_index($chr, $pos);
      $obj->block_seek($real, $virtual); #move to position

      #read features one after the other to perform analysis
      while(my $f = $obj->next_feature){
        my ($real, $virtual) = $f->offsets();
      }

DESCRIPTION
    BGZFast::hts_manipulator provides a mechanism to easilly navegate and
    manipulate high throughput sequence related file formats that have been
    indexed. This allows these BGZF compressed files to be shattered and
    partitioned for parallel processing and streaming.

INDEXING
    Indexing can be performed using the $obj->make_index method

     -idx_type     Predefined index type (SAM, VCF, GENERIC, ZERO)     GENERIC
     -idx_col      Seq, start, and end columns to use for indexing     [1,4,5]
     -idx_meta     Meta data character to use when parsing file        #
     -idx_skip     Count of lines to always skip for header            0

  header
     Title   : header
     Usage   : my $header = $obj->header();
     Function: Get header from file.
     Returns : A BGZFast::header object.
     Args    : None

  feature_stat
     Title   : feature_stat
     Usage   : ($length,
                $refid,

     Function: Get basic feature info from string
     Returns : Feature length, ref ID, beginning pos, end pos, next ref ID for
               split features, next pos
               (returns undef for partial features)
